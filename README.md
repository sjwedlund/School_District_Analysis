# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has notified us of evidence of academic dishonesty amongst ninth graders at Thomas High School. I have replaced the math and reading scores of Thomas High School ninth graders, and repeated the analysis to see how the changes have affected the overall analysis.

## Results
### How is the district summary affected?
Changing the reading and math scores for the Thomas High School ninth graders changes the passing averages for the entire district. A few of them are changed by a tenth of a percent

### How is the school summary affected? How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School remains in second place in the top 5 schools when the ninth grade scores are replaced. Taking out their scores makes everyone else’s scores go up for the whole school.

- Math and reading scores by grade are not affected, because we merely replaced the affected scores for the affected group. However it does affect the passing math, passing reading, and overall passing scores for individual schools by about 7%.
- Replacing the scores improves the passing math, passing reading, and overall p passing percentages for all spending ranges.
- Replacing scores improves the passing math, passing reading, and overall passing percentages for small and large schools, and decreases the percentages for medium size schools by about 1%.
- Scores by both charter and district schools were slightly positively affected by replacing the THS ninth grader scores.
